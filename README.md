This game will manage a human player vs computer tictactoe game. It will draw the screen, posts the user's input,
and post the computer opponent's input.

The game logic is missing. The game selects its position randomly. If the position is empty, that position is used. If that position
is not empty the game randomly selects another position until an empty position is found.

The game looks for a win, either player or computer, and if a win is detected a small 'winner!' message is printed.

If all of the positions are filled and there is no win, the game announces a draw.

Todo:
    I would like to improve the game logic but that seems out of reach at the moment.
    Input and output will need to be tailored to the I/O device used by the microcontroller.
